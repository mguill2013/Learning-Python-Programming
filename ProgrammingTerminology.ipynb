    "# A statement is a part of the program which executes something. It often, but not always, refers to a single command.\n",
    "# For example, print(\"Hi!\") is a statement. number = 2 is also a statement.\n",
    "# A statement can also be more complicated:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# A block is a group of consecutive statements that are at the same level in the strucutre of the program. \n",
    "# For example, the block of a conditional statement contains those statements which are executed only if the condition is true. \n",
